            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hey! I'm Cat, a 15 year old aspiring developer. My pronouns are she/they (I prefer she/her), and I'm trans! I don't actually have a system, but I have quite a few friends who do! One of them showed me PluralKit and after looking into the API, I was inspired to make this website. If I use any incorrect terms or you have any problems using this website, please message me at Cat#0102 on Discord or <a href="https://twitter.com/klepticat">@KleptiCat</a> on Twitter!</p>
            <h1>About My[System]</h1>
            <p>As I said above, I have a few friends with systems, and one of them showed me the PluralKit Discord bot, and after looking into the PluralKit API, I wanted to create a website for viewing information on your system in an easy-on-the-eyes format, without the need to run through a bunch of the PluralKit commands. In the future, I hope to expand this to include a way to add, edit, and delete members of your system. As well as this, I want to create a mobile app that allows you to add switches on the go, even when not using Discord to help keep track of who is fronting when and how often.</p>
            <p>Of course, for roleplayers that use PluralKit, the use cases for My[System] are similar, allowing for a way to view characters of yours and others as well as their descriptions, pronouns, etc.</p>
            <p>All that is needed to view a system is the Discord ID of one of the Discord Users linked to the system, which can be found by enabling Developer Mode and right clicking on a user. Once I get a better grasp on the Discord API, it may be possible to search for systems by Discord name and discriminator (#????) alone.</p>
            <p>This website is open source and available on <a href="https://github.com/klepticat/my-system/">GitHub</a>! If you have any suggestions or would like to fix my horrible UI please go ahead and do that on GitHub.</p>
